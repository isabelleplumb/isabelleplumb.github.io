				<h1>Sister</h1>
				<p>I wanted to stop running, I really, really did. My limbs felt like they were on fire, and each gasping breath I drew in felt like I was slammed against a truck going down the freeway. I couldn’t seem to stop though, and every time I stumbled, something pulled me up and kept me going. It wasn’t quite determination, no, it was something more simple and mindless. It was the sheer desperation of a hunted animal that knows it won’t be running much longer. </p>
				<p>If I could feel much else besides burning pain in my extremities, I’d probably notice the numerous cuts tracing across the exposed skin of my arms from the twigs that reached from the dark and tore at me, trying to slow me down. </p>
				<p>It was pitch black, and every time I felt something brush by me I wanted to scream, but I didn’t have enough air in my lungs, and the small part of my brain that was still thinking rationally told me to be as quiet as I could. It probably wasn’t any use anyways. In the midnight quiet of the forest, my labored breathing and crunching, thundering footsteps probably marked my presence just as much as a shriek would have. </p>
				<p>I had to get out of here, I had to find a way out of here. If I could just find some way back to my campsite, I would be safe. </p>
				<p>Something snagged my right ankle and before I knew it I was flying through the darkness. The feeling was disconcerting, and if my heartbeat wasn’t already pounding through my ears, it would have been by now. It was also short, and what probably wasn’t even seconds later, I felt a sharp, tearing pain coarse through my right ankle, and then something flat and unforgiving slammed into me. Oh no, no no no no no no no. Clenching my fists, I tremblingly raised myself up and propped myself on my elbows. An experimental tug on my leg sent pain shooting up. There was no way I would be able to walk. Not without passing out at least.</p>
				<p>God, I wish I had never gone on that camping trip. I wish I had never wandered off. I wish that I did something differently, something that wouldn’t have ended like this. Hunted like an animal through the forest. </p>
				<p>"Run, Girl." They told me. "You’ll live longer if you play along."</p>
				<p>I took in a deep breath and tried to make myself as quiet as possible. If I couldn’t run from them, I could at least try and hide. That wouldn’t last though, these things weren’t human, they couldn’t be. No human looked like that, no human could move like that. I had to find some way out of here. Reaching out blindly with my right hand, hoping to find something, maybe a tree that I could use to pull myself up, I felt something cool, metal, and perpendicular to the ground. It felt a bit like some sort of small pole. Only, what was a pole doing in the middle of the woods. No, could it be? My dashed hopes suddenly sputtered back to life and I reached out and, gripping the pole, pulled myself up. My leg screamed at me the entire way up, but I tried to block it out, keeping my breathing even to not faint. Unconsciousness would be very bad right about now. </p>
				<p>At about waist height, the pole curved abruptly to the side, and on top sat some kind of dial, or wheel. My fingers were practically shaking with the adrenaline rush. My mind was chanting one syllable over and over again, like a prayer. Camp, camp, camp. Waterspouts were found near campgrounds.</p>
				<p>Something akin to relief broke over me, chasing away all of the negative thoughts. They weren’t herding me in this direction after all. I wasn’t doomed, I could make it through this! Letting out an insane-sounding, high pitched giggle, I stumbled forwards on will alone, and when I tripped, I caught myself on something in front of me. A wall, a wall made of what felt like rough wood, and what smelled like a sewer. The outhouse. There was a flashlight in the outhouse, my adrenaline-hazed brain offered up. Fumbling my way around the building seemed to take forever, and I tripped on the way in, but when I closed my hand around the heavy cylinder of metal, it was all worth it. When I turned around and clicked the flashlight on, it shone brightly, almost blinding me for a second. </p>
				<p> the first place. Either way, I managed to limp my way forwards and shine the light around. It was out camp, it really was, I wasn’t imagining it. </p>
				<p>Huh, crashing in here I should have woken someone up. Maybe they just thought I was a bear or something and were all huddled together in their tents.</p>
				<p>Any other time like this I would have been tempted to do something like sneak up on them, but now really wasn’t an ideal moment for that. Now, I needed to wake up Seth so that he could drive me into town, I really didn’t trust myself behind a wheel right now. Then I paused for a minute and wanted to slap myself for being so selfish. I had to wake up everyone! There were those monster freaks somewhere out there, and we all needed to be gone ASAP.</p>
				<p>“Hey!” I yelled, my voice hoarse and slightly breathy. “Everyone! Wake-up!” Not a movement, nor a sound greeted my actions. Not even a ‘go back to sleep Casey’, or a muffled groan of complaint. “Guys, I’m serious!” I practically screamed, my voice climbing an octave with the growing desperation. I was standing in the middle of the tent-circle, right next to the remains of the wimpy fire that Jade had tried to make out of tissues and wet matches. There was no way that they could not hear me. Panic was starting to set in. </p>
				<p>There, there was the tent I shared with Jade. My twin sister woke up when a car passed on the street, there had to be something wrong. Rushing towards the pink cloth monstrosity as fast as I could, with my stumbling gait it still felt like it took forever. </p>
				<p>“Jade!” I called, fumbling for the zipper to the tent. It was the kind with one on the outside and one on the inside. Finally wrenching it open, I shined the light inside and saw… nothing.</p>
				<p>Not quite nothing though. The tent was a disaster area. The sleeping bags were strewn all over the tent, both hers and mine, and there were feathers covering the ground, as well as tattered remains of the pillowcase.</p>
				<p>“Jade?” It was almost a whisper. No, she couldn’t be gone, no. Not my sister, not Jade. Backing away, I tripped over something and fell flat on my back, the impact jarring the breath out of my lungs and the flashlight out of my hands. What did I trip over? There hadn’t been anything there five seconds ago when I was walking this way. Reaching around for my flashlight, I felt my had come into contact with something wet and squishy. Didn’t feel like moss. Left a wet residue on my hand though. I didn’t have time to wipe it off though, because only moments later I felt my fingertips brush against the smooth metal of the flashlight.</p>
				<p>Whatever was on my hands made the lifesaving light slippery, but I managed to grasp in on my third try. I sat up and clicked it on. It didn’t illuminate my hands, so I couldn’t see what that liquid was. </p>
				<p>Still begs the question, what did I trip over? Shining the flashlight down by my feet, my breath caught as the light shone upon… A human leg. No, this couldn’t be happening. The beam moved up the body and I saw Seth, lying on his side, his eyes open and empty. I screamed bloody murder because that was exactly what had happened. I screamed and the added adrenaline pushed me to my feet. </p>
				<p>What my flashlight fell on next, made the screams pushing their way up my throat turn liquid and chunky. Luke, Jade’s boyfriend, was lying there, his stomach slit open and his intestines spilling out. What I had touched… No. When I was done tossing my lunch, I switched flashlight hands and aimed the light towards my hand. My fingertips were red, and smeared with blood. I gagged, and probably would have thrown up again if there was anything left in my stomach. </p>
				<p>Something told me that this wasn’t over yet, but I was terrified to look. I didn’t want to know, I didn’t want to see. These bodies hadn’t all been here before, not when I had first crossed the camp ground. That fact would have horrified me if I wasn’t already starting to feel emotionally numb. </p>
				<p>Moving the beam slowly, I saw a small pile. In the shadows it looked like a pile of luggage. But in direct lighting there was no mistaking it for what it was. A pile of bodies. I couldn’t make out features from this distance, but I saw curly hair that belonged to Shelly, and a tattoo that was unmistakably Zach’s. My mind had a new mantra now, and it wasn’t until then that I realized that I was screaming it aloud.</p>
				<p>“No!” Anything that hunted me could most definitely hear me, but after I turned around, I didn’t care. Because lying there spread eagled on the ground, was Jade. Her eyes were open, glassy, and staring straight at me.  Her shirt, the dorky family t-shirt that our parents made us get, was all slashed up and soaked through with blood. Her arms were bare, and covered in cut-marks, and her throat… her throat was slit ear-to ear. That wasn’t what made me scream though, wasn’t what made me want to crumple to the ground and give up, wasn’t what sent chills so deep into my bones that my whole body went numb. No, that was the twisted, elated, terrifying grin she wore as she looked at me. </p>
				<p>That grin was the last thing I ever saw, and just before the world went dark, I could swear I heard Jade’s voice, whispering in my ear in a sing-song voice.</p>
				<p>‘You’re next, sister.” </p>
